# SavyUniversity
Home of anything and everything to do with Savy University!

The purpose of this repository is to document and collaborate on the configuration and inner-workings of the Savy University network.  By sharing this information with everyone involved, I aim to give transparency to those interested into how the environment is configured and how it works in hopes that people may learn from the information and be able to understand concepts they previously had not grasped.

None of the information here will violate the privacy or jeopardize the security of Savant CTS nor the employees in it.
