# SavyUniversity
Home of anything and everything to do with Savy University!

The purpose of this repository is to document and collaborate on lab-like activities for educational reasons.  By sharing this information with everyone interested, I hope more and more people will grow their own sense of discovery and excitement when it comes to adopting new, unfamiliar technologies and continuing to expand their skill sets in this ever-changing world of computing.

Current endeavor involves continuously maturing the ability to create re-usable infrastructure as code in Azure.

None of the information here will violate the privacy or jeopardize the security of Savant CTS or its employees.

Next objectives:
- install web services on the DMEO VMs using powershell remoting
- get rudimentary web content up on the VMs and be able to browse it from Sandbox
- get a public IP address for the DEMO resource group
- get a load balancer in place for the DEMO resource group
